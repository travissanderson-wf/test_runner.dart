Test Runner for Dart is an open source project. It is licensed using the
[BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE).
We appreciate pull requests, here are our guidelines:

1. File a bug at https://github.com/google/test_runner.dart/issues (if there
isnâ€™t one already). If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea
to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it in a new issue
beforehand.
1. Make sure that patches provide justification for why they should be merged.
Test Runner for Dart is an opinionated project and as such, patches which add
support for alternative choices to those we prescribe are not guaranteed to
land.
1. Due to legal reasons, all contributors must sign a contributor license
agreement, either for an
[individual](https://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html) or
[corporation](https://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html), before a
patch can be accepted.
1. We ask that you squash all the commits together before pushing.

Contributing is awesome. You should do it :)
